# gannhiro's attempt at Advent of Code 2025!

## Good news! This is made with zig!
Zig is so fun to build with and I have learned so much with zig, low-level concepts and the zig language itself.

## Bad news! Day 3 part 2 is too hard for me!
☺️ it's too hard! might have to watch some videos for it!
Edit: 12/06/2026, solved it, time to move on!
